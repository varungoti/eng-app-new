1. Configure npm to Always Use Legacy Peer Dependencies
To avoid having to add the --legacy-peer-deps flag every time, you can configure npm to use it by default:

npm config set legacy-peer-deps true


This will save you from having to type --legacy-peer-deps with every npm install command.
2. Address Vulnerabilities (Optional)
You can run:

### npm audit fix



This will fix vulnerabilities that don't require breaking changes. For more critical issues, you might need to review them individually.
3. Document the Solution
Add a note to your project's README or documentation about using legacy peer dependencies:
Or configure npm to use it by default:

### 4. Use the Custom Scripts for Future Dependency Management

Remember to use the custom scripts we created for managing dependencies:

- `npm run check-deps` - To check for compatibility issues
- `npm run fix-deps` - To fix dependency issues
- `npm run fix-deps-aggressive` - For more stubborn dependency issues
- `npm run add-dep` - To safely add new dependencies

## Conclusion

Your package.json compatibility issues have been successfully resolved! The key was:

1. Aligning all TipTap packages to use the same version series (3.0.0-next.x)
2. Using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts

Your project should now build and run without dependency-related errors. The remaining vulnerabilities are common in large JavaScript projects and can be addressed gradually as needed.
