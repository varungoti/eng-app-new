  # Fix Schools RLS Policies

  1. Changes:
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies that allow authenticated users to perform CRUD operations
    - Add proper role-based access control
    - Ensure backward compatibility

  2. Security:
    - Maintain RLS on all tables
    - Allow authenticated users basic access
    - Add role-specific permissions
