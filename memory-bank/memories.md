# SpeakWell English Learning Application - Memories

## Overview
This document contains important memories, decisions, and notes related to the SpeakWell English Learning Application. It serves as a reference for key information that should be remembered across development sessions.

## Technical Decisions

### Memory Bank System Implementation (2025-04-09)
**Decision**: Implement a Memory Bank system for task management and project documentation.

**Rationale**: The Memory Bank system provides a structured approach to development with persistent memory across sessions. It helps track tasks, maintain focus, and preserve important information throughout the development process. This will improve project organization and ensure consistent progress tracking.

### Database Migration to Supabase (2025-04-01)
**Decision**: Migrate from MongoDB to Supabase for database storage.

**Rationale**: Supabase provides a more comprehensive solution with built-in authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities. It also offers better scalability and easier maintenance compared to our MongoDB setup.

### Role-Based Access Control Implementation (2025-04-02)
**Decision**: Implement a granular role-based access control system with multiple user roles and permission levels.

**Rationale**: The application needs to support various user types (admins, teachers, students, etc.) with different access levels. A granular RBAC system allows for precise control over what each user can see and do.

### Fish Speech Integration for TTS (2025-04-03)
**Decision**: Use Fish Speech API for text-to-speech capabilities instead of building our own solution.

**Rationale**: Fish Speech provides high-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis with support for multiple languages. Integrating with their API saves development time and provides better results than we could achieve in-house.

## Important Notes

### Memory Bank System Integration (2025-04-09)
The Memory Bank system has been integrated with the project development workflow to track tasks, maintain focus, and preserve important information. The system includes automation features like Git hooks, automatic updates based on commit messages, and scheduled updates. All team members should use the Memory Bank system to keep track of their work and update it regularly.

### File Tree and User Chat Logging (2025-04-09)
Added file-tree.md to track the project's file-folder structure and user-chats.md to log user input chats with the Agent. The file-tree.md is automatically updated when files are created or modified, and the user-chats.md can be updated using the log-chat script. These features help maintain a comprehensive record of the project's structure and development history.

### Supabase Schema Design Considerations (2025-04-05)
The database schema is designed with a hierarchical structure (Grades > Topics > Subtopics > Lessons > Questions > Exercise Prompts) to allow for flexible content organization. Each level has a one-to-many relationship with the level below it.

### Performance Optimization for Media Content (2025-04-08)
Media content (images, audio, video) should be stored in Supabase Storage and served through their CDN. For optimal performance, we should implement lazy loading for media content and use appropriate compression techniques.

## Ideas

### Gamification Elements (2025-04-06)
Add gamification elements to increase student engagement:
- Points for completing lessons and exercises
- Badges for achievements
- Leaderboards for friendly competition
- Streaks for consistent usage
- Virtual rewards for milestone achievements

### AI-Generated Content (2025-04-07)
Explore using AI to generate lesson content:
- Templates for different lesson types
- AI-assisted content creation for teachers
- Automatic generation of practice exercises
- Personalized content based on student performance

## Questions and Answers

### Q: How should we handle offline access to lessons?
**A**: We should implement a progressive web app (PWA) approach where:
1. Core lesson content is cached for offline use
2. Students can complete lessons offline
3. Progress is synchronized when they reconnect
4. Media content has fallbacks for offline mode
5. We use IndexedDB for local storage of progress data

### Q: What's the best approach for implementing the assessment module?
**A**: The assessment module should:
1. Support multiple question types (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, speaking, etc.)
2. Provide immediate feedback when possible
3. Use adaptive difficulty based on student performance
4. Include both automated and teacher-graded components
5. Generate detailed reports for teachers and parents
