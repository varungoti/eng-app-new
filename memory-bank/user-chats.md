## Memory Bank System Implementation (2025-04-09 15:30)

**User**: Varun Goti

```
I want you to integrate our memory-bank and task management with our project development and update it regularly to track the project status and plan and execute the next tasks.

I also want to add a script to update a file in the same folder of the memory-bank that contains our project's file-folder tree and the file gets updated when a file is created.

Make another file that logs all user input chats that are shared here with the Agent to carry on the work in the project.
