# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Database seeding implementation
- Environment configuration
- System stability improvements

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive database seeding scripts
- Implemented test data generation for all models
- Added seeding scripts to package.json
- Set up environment-specific seeding options
- Updated seeding scripts to use ES modules
- Added detailed logging for seeding process

## Active Decisions
1. Using Faker.js for realistic test data generation
2. Implementing seeding in dependency order
3. Adding environment-specific seeding options
4. Maintaining data integrity in seeded data

## Next Steps
1. Configure Supabase credentials for development environment
2. Test seeding scripts in development environment
3. Implement database backup procedures
4. Set up monitoring for database performance

## Current Considerations
- Need to ensure proper data validation in seeded data
- Consider implementing data cleanup scripts
- Plan for database scaling
- Monitor query performance
- Ensure secure handling of environment variables

## Blockers
- Missing Supabase credentials for development environment
- Need to set up proper environment variable handling

## Notes
- All major database migrations are now complete
- Seeding scripts are ready but need proper environment configuration
- Focus shifting to environment setup and security
- Need to implement proper environment variable management
